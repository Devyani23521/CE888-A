## PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
The goal of this project is to build a system that can forecast the availability of excess renewable energy 24 hours in advance for a data scientist working for an energy company. This effort was prompted by the necessity to provide free energy to local customers during periods of excess energy, such as solar or wind power, especially in light of the present growing energy costs. In order to assess the efficacy of the plan, the initiative intends to conduct a pilot test in May 2024, initially with a subset of clients.
To ascertain whether it is feasible to forecast energy surpluses with any degree of accuracy, the project entails evaluating historical meteorological and energy production data from 2000 to the present. For the business to avoid the hefty expenses linked with false positives—the offering of free energy without any real surplus—this predictive technology is essential. The project's success depends on comprehensive data exploration, strong modeling to guarantee precise forecasts, and careful evaluation of operational and external factors influencing the production and consumption of energy.

## ASSUMPTIONS:
Uniformity in Past Information: We make the assumption that the company's historical data on energy generation from solar and wind sources is reliable, consistent, and indicative of production capacities both now and in the future. It is assumed that there are no substantial reporting gaps or inaccuracies in this data that could cause the forecasting model to be misled (Rodríguez,2020)
Weather Predictability: Using current meteorological data and models, it is expected that weather conditions, which have a substantial impact on the generation of solar and wind energy, can be properly projected 24 hours in advance. This includes presumptions regarding the accuracy of solar intensity, wind speed, and duration forecasts (Rodríguez,2020).
Stability of Renewable Technology: For the duration of the forecast and implementation period, we assume that the output and efficiency of the current renewable energy technologies, such as wind turbines and solar panels, will remain unchanged. There won't be any major advancements or regressions in technology that could have an impact on output levels (Devisingh,2018).

GENERAL ASSUMPTIONS:
Geographic Consistency: Within the catchment area, assumptions are made regarding the consistency of the weather and consumption patterns. It is presumed that the study locations don't show significant variations in the weather or consumer behavior that would compromise the precision of local energy forecasts.
Grid Integration and Storage: It is considered that excess energy can be distributed effectively and losslessly inside the grid architecture. Moreover, it is anticipated that all energy storage devices, including batteries and hydroelectric storage, will function flawlessly and without any malfunctions.
